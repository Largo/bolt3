Bolt 3 on PHP 8.1
===

Welcome to the Bolt 3 Fork for PHP 8.0 and 8.1!

PHP 7.4 will not receive security updates after 25 November 2022.
This project allows you to run Bolt 3 on a security supported version until 28 November 2024. 

Why?
---
Bolt 5 is sadly missing a lot of extensions like menueditor, emailobfuscator, menuchain.
Updating multi-language sites is also not trivial.
If you are not under these constraints, please consider updating to Bolt 5.

How to update from the official version:
-------

Adapt your composer.json to the snippet below.
Then run composer update.

Warning:
-------
Deprecation Errors are hidden.
So far all functions appear to work correctly, but we do not offer any guarantees.
This project might work on PHP 8.2, but it will not work in it's current form on PHP 9.0,
when the deprecated functions will probably be removed.


Authors
-----
PHP 8.1 Adaption work by Largo.
Thanks to Two Kings and Friends for Bolt!
